# PlatformIO Wokwi ESP32

A reusable ESP32 DevKit starter project for PlatformIO, Wokwi and Velxio.

Use this repository as a base for ESP32 projects that need local development with PlatformIO and circuit simulation with Wokwi or Velxio. It works in VS Code and in Zed.

## Included

- PlatformIO configuration for the ESP32 DevKit (`esp32dev`), pinned to the official `platformio/espressif32 @ 7.1.3` platform (arduino-esp32 2.0.17). For arduino-esp32 3.x see the `dev/arduino-3` branch
- Arduino framework, serial monitor at 115200 baud
- Wokwi simulation with an ESP32 DevKit C v4 wired to the serial monitor
- Velxio simulation from a merged 4 MB flash image built on every `pio run`
- Zed tasks and clangd setup
- `mise.toml` with pinned `pio` and `wokwi-cli`
- Standard PlatformIO project structure

## Getting started

This project works best in conjunction with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [PlatformIO IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide), and [Wokwi Simulator for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Wokwi.wokwi-vscode).

Install the tools before opening the project:

1. [Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. [Install PlatformIO IDE in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide)
3. [Install Wokwi Simulator in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Wokwi.wokwi-vscode)

Clone this repository and open it in VS Code.

### Using Zed

The project also works in [Zed](https://zed.dev/) through the [PlatformIO Core CLI](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/index.html) (`pio`) and, optionally, the [Wokwi CLI](https://docs.wokwi.com/wokwi-ci/cli-installation) (`wokwi-cli`, needs a `WOKWI_CLI_TOKEN`).

1. Install PlatformIO Core and make sure `pio` is on your `PATH`, or run `mise install` to get `pio` and `wokwi-cli` from `mise.toml` with [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/)
2. Open the folder in Zed
3. Run `task: spawn` (`alt-shift-t`) and pick a task from `.zed/tasks.json`:
   - Build and upload: `Build`, `Upload`, `Upload and Monitor`, `Serial Monitor`, `Clean`, `Test`, `Program Size`, `Verbose Build`, `Static Code Analysis`, `Erase Flash`, `Erase Flash and Upload`
   - Ports: `List Devices (Serial Ports)`, `Select Port`, `Upload to Port …`, `Serial Monitor on Port …`
   - Libraries: `Search Libraries for …`, `Install Library …`, `Uninstall Library …`, `List Installed Packages`, `Check Outdated Packages`, `Update Packages`
   - Other: `Search Boards for …`, `System Info`, `Open PIO Home`, `Generate compile_commands.json (clangd)`
   - `Wokwi: Simulate` (build first)
4. Run the `compile_commands.json` task once (and again after changing `platformio.ini` or libraries) so clangd can resolve `Arduino.h` and the ESP32 headers. `.clangd` removes GCC-only Xtensa flags that clang does not understand.

Build the project with:

```bash
pio run
```

The first build downloads the ESP32 toolchain and Arduino core, so it takes a while.

The Wokwi configuration uses the PlatformIO build output:

- Firmware: `.pio/build/esp32dev/firmware.bin`
- ELF: `.pio/build/esp32dev/firmware.elf`

Edit `src/main.cpp` to add your application code and `diagram.json` to add components and wiring for your simulation.

### Using Velxio

[Velxio](https://velxio.dev/) is an open-source browser simulator for Arduino, ESP32 and Raspberry Pi boards. It runs ESP32 firmware in QEMU, which boots from a full flash image instead of the app-only `firmware.bin`, so `merge_firmware.py` runs after every build and writes:

- Merged image: `.pio/build/esp32dev/firmware.merged.bin` (bootloader, partitions, `boot_app0` and app, 4 MB, DIO)

To run it in the [Velxio editor](https://velxio.dev/editor/) (free, no install):

1. Build the project with `pio run`
2. Add an **ESP32 DevKit C V4** board (or ESP32 DevKit V1) to the canvas
3. Pick **Upload firmware** from the menu, select `firmware.merged.bin` and start the simulation
4. Open the Serial Monitor to see `2 + 3 = 5`

`velxio.toml` points the [Velxio VS Code extension](https://github.com/davidmonterocrespo24/velxio/tree/master/vscode-extension) (needs a Velxio Pro subscription or trial) at the same merged image, so `Velxio: Run Simulation` loads it without compiling. Velxio has no standalone CLI, so there is no Zed task or `mise.toml` entry for it.

### Libraries and ports from Zed

Zed tasks can't ask for input, so the tasks ending in `…` use the text selected in the editor. They only show up in `task: spawn` while something is selected:

- **Find and add a library:** type a name such as `DHT` anywhere (a scratch buffer works), select it and run `Search Libraries for "DHT"`. Then select the full name from the results, e.g. `adafruit/DHT sensor library`, and run `Install Library`. It is added to `lib_deps` in `platformio.ini`.
- **Pick a port once:** run `Select Port`. It lists the serial ports, asks for a number in the terminal and saves your choice in `port.local.ini` (git-ignored), which every upload and monitor then uses. Choose `0` to go back to auto-detect.
- **Use a port just once:** select a port name such as `COM3` or `/dev/ttyUSB0` and run `Upload to Port` or `Serial Monitor on Port`.

In the task picker, `tab` lets you edit a task's command before running it, e.g. to add flags.

All of these are plain `pio` commands, so they work the same on Windows and Linux and from any terminal: `pio pkg search dht`, `pio pkg install --library "adafruit/DHT sensor library"`, `pio device list`, `pio run -t select_port`.

## Linux and Windows setup

Both setups use [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to install the pinned `pio` and `wokwi-cli` from `mise.toml`. If you already have PlatformIO Core on your `PATH`, skip the mise steps.

### Linux

1. Install mise and enable it in your shell:

   ```bash
   curl https://mise.run | sh
   echo 'eval "$(~/.local/bin/mise activate bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc   # or ~/.zshrc with "activate zsh"
   ```

2. In the project folder, install the tools:

   ```bash
   mise trust && mise install
   ```

3. Allow uploads to the board without `sudo` (PlatformIO udev rules and serial group), then log out and back in:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformio/platformio-core/develop/platformio/assets/system/99-platformio-udev.rules | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-platformio-udev.rules
   sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
   sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER   # on Arch-based distros the group is "uucp"
   ```

4. Optional: install Zed with `curl -f https://zed.dev/install.sh | sh`.
5. Optional, for `wokwi-cli`: `export WOKWI_CLI_TOKEN=<token>` (add it to `~/.bashrc` to keep it).

The board shows up as `/dev/ttyUSB0` (CP210x/CH340) or `/dev/ttyACM0`. **WSL:** build and simulate inside WSL, but USB devices are not visible there by default. Upload from Windows, or attach the board with [usbipd-win](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/connect-usb).

### Windows

1. Install mise from PowerShell, with `winget install jdx.mise` or `scoop install mise`.
2. Make the tools available in every terminal: add `%LOCALAPPDATA%\mise\shims` to your user `PATH`, or add `mise activate pwsh | Out-String | Invoke-Expression` to your PowerShell `$PROFILE`.
3. In the project folder, install the tools:

   ```powershell
   mise trust; mise install
   ```

4. Install the USB-to-serial driver if Windows doesn't detect the board: ESP32 DevKit boards use a CP210x ([Silicon Labs driver](https://www.silabs.com/developer-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)) or CH340 ([WCH driver](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH341SER_EXE.html)) chip; check the chip near the USB connector.
5. Optional: install [Zed for Windows](https://zed.dev/download).
6. Optional, for `wokwi-cli`: `setx WOKWI_CLI_TOKEN "<token>"`, then open a new terminal.

The board shows up as a `COM` port (for example `COM3`). Check **Device Manager > Ports (COM & LPT)** or run `pio device list`.

PlatformIO picks the upload port automatically on both systems. To choose one, run `pio run -t select_port` (or the `Select Port` Zed task), or add `upload_port = COM3` (Windows) or `upload_port = /dev/ttyUSB0` (Linux) to the `[env]` section of `platformio.ini`.
